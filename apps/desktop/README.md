# Electron Desktop Shell

The Electron-based shell hosts the Solicitor UI and provides native integrations. Auto-update is
disabled by default in this scaffold to align with the offline-first milestone goals.

## Development

Install dependencies from the monorepo root (`npm install`) and use the workspace script stubs as
placeholders until the real Electron build pipeline is added.
