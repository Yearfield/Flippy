# Definition of Done

The project adopts the global Definition of Done outlined in the product brief:

- All acceptance criteria for the relevant milestone are satisfied on Windows and macOS.
- Automated unit, integration, or end-to-end tests cover new functionality where practical.
- First-run diagnostics report no critical errors.
- Performance targets for loading large PDFs and running conversions asynchronously are met.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and basic screen reader labels are available for primary workflows.
- Documentation within `/docs` and user-facing release notes are updated for new toggles or workflows.
